# Tidy ledger

Rejected, deferred or doubtful tidy ideas, so later research rounds do not re-propose them. One
line each: what, why.

## W1 core-webkit

- Kept `GLTFValidationReport.isClean`: only tests read it now that the badges are gone, but it is the report's one summary predicate; revisit with the validator surface.
- Deferred `JointNames.synthesized` / `GLTFInspectorError` to private or RealityKit, and `PNGWriter`'s `"StillRenderer"` error domain (chunk I extras): crosses into the realitykit lane / renames a domain; not dead code.
- Deferred chunk F live parts to wave 2 with the file split: `reset()` → `fit()`, the second load-copy re-show after `start`, and the stale "First step of the viewport migration" header on `WebPreviewCanvas`.
- Kept `WebPreviewCanvas.dismantleNSView(first, coordinator:)` in `WebCanvasControllerTests.remountAdoptsTheRunningPage`: it now calls the protocol's default no-op, which is what SwiftUI does on a remount; the test still proves adoption.
- `GLTFInspectorTests/RealityKit/CameraFramingTests.swift` gained `@testable import GLTFCore`: it builds `GLTFSessionDocument.Camera` values, whose memberwise init is now internal (D).

## W1 host

- F2.3 publish `canvasState.isReady ? viewport.commands : nil` (`DocumentShell`) — deferred: a behaviour change (menus disabled while loading), not a deletion; belongs with chunk C/F or a ticket. Today commands of the last ready canvas stay registered while the next document loads.
- `RendererAvailability.canHideNodes`, `\.shellPanelChrome`, `Availability.hasSkin` — out of W1 scope by plan (chunks C / E).
- Optional JSON-only transform/euler assertion on `EngineSelectionModel.detail` (to replace deleted `SelectionDetailTests`) — not added: tests-only addition, not a delete; camera/light/mesh detail stays covered by `EngineViewportRealityKitTests`. Candidate for the tests lane.
- `@State private var playbackController = EngineAnimationPlaybackController()` still allocates an empty controller + `RealityClipPlayer` per `RealityDocumentWindow` init (SwiftUI discards it after the first) — accepted: per parent re-init instead of per body; a lazy optional would bring back the `??` branch.
- Lane overlap: chunk A/B touched `GLTFInspector/RealityKit/{EngineSceneModel+RealityKit,PreviewView,HostPreviewContainer,RealityDocumentWindow}.swift` (assigned in the host note); watch for merge conflicts with the realitykit lane.

### Bugs seen

- None in product code. Harness note: `log stream --predicate 'process == "glTF Inspector"'` also captures other worktrees' test-host apps (same process name, e.g. "open failed cube.gltf: boom"); filter the real-window check by the launched pid.
